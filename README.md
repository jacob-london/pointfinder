# pointfinder
Find points that work for slope-intercept graphs
------------------------------------------------
To use, input the slope, then the y-intercept, the value of x that you would like to start with, and the increment you would like to count in.

Note: fractions do not work at the moment, and will be released in a later version, for now, use strictly decimals.
